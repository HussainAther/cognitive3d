## **Getting Started**

### Prerequisites

1. Unity or Unreal Engine installed.
2. Cognitive3D SDK.
3. Node.js and npm for dashboard development (optional).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/AlterLearning/cognitive3d-integration.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the `integration/` directory and set up the Cognitive3D SDK in your project.
3. Follow the instructions in the `docs/` folder to configure API keys and analytics endpoints.

### Running the Project

- Load the VR/AR scenes from the `scenes/` directory in your preferred engine.
- Test the integration by simulating user behavior and observing the data flow to Cognitive3D dashboards.
